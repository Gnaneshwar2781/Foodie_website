# Foodie - Food Delivery Website

**Foodie** is a front-end food delivery website designed using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal of this project was to create a clean, user-friendly interface for a food ordering platform, showcasing modern design elements and layout techniques without using any JavaScript or backend technologies.

The website includes a homepage with a promotional offer, a navigation bar with search and location inputs, and call-to-action buttons like Register and Login. This project helped strengthen my skills in building responsive layouts, using Flexbox, gradients, and box shadows to achieve a professional and engaging look.

It is a fully static website and serves as a UI prototype for future integration with interactive features and backend services.
